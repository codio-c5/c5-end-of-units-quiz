# Solution
**Asymmetric key cryptography solves the problem of key distribution in symmetric key cryptography. It also helps with key management, as each party only needs to have only a private and a public key, whereas in symmetric cryptography he/she needs as many keys as the number of people he/she is communicating with.*
